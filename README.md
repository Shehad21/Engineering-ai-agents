# Engineering AI Agents

This repository tracks my journey to learn and build AI agents for my HVAC/Data Center engineering work.

## Goals
- Learn AI (no-code → Python → frameworks).
- Build agents for:
  - Submittal checking
  - HVAC load calculation
  - Structural base deflection
  - Pipe stress helper
  - Fastener selection
- Integrate with tools I use: SolidWorks, AutoCAD, PDM, Infor LN.

## Week Log
**Week 1**
- Created GitHub repo
- Started Google AI Essentials
- Built first Flowise Submittal Checker Agent

**Week 2**
- HVAC Load Sheet + Flowise integration
- First n8n automation
